# start-page
a basic start page for web browsers

This is a basic html page to be loaded as a start page in any web browser.

## Features
- Google Calendar
- Customizable Quick Links and Categories
- Auto-focusing Google Search bar
- Easy-to-use interface with right-click to configure

## Instructions
To setup, check out [Simple Start Page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simple-start-page/penpdmhpelafnfaeidigoapommfeoeai) on the chrome store and add it to your browser. You'll then need to get an ID for your Google Calendar, but I've made a list of [easy steps you can follow](https://github.com/hawkins/start-page/wiki/Set-Up-Google-Calendar) for that.

And that's it, you're done!
